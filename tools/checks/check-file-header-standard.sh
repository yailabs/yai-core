# YAI - file header standard guard
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensure the repository has an active ownership/header standard and that the
#   principal ownership surfaces carry short agent-readable notes.
#
# Scope:
#   Checks doctrine docs, wave/extraction references, top-level build surface,
#   guard headers and principal directory READMEs.
#
# Non-goals:
#   This guard does not yet enforce headers across every .c, .h or .rs file.
