# Testing Doctrine

Tests must falsify the spine. If the core cannot decide, receipt, store, reconstruct or project, tests must expose that.

## Primitive Coverage

| Primitive | First proof |
|---|---|
| `case` | open case creates case ref and posture |
| `subject` | bind subject creates case-scoped subject binding |
| `op` | submit attempt targets subject refs |
| `control` | decision record has gates, outcome and basis |
| `effect` | null carrier or observed path produces receipt posture |
| `store` | append persists attempt, decision and receipt records |
| `graph` | reconstruction can relate case, subject, attempt, decision and receipt |
| `memory` | memory is derived only from scoped residue |
| `projection` | query returns controlled read model with provenance |
| `reconcile` | receipt gaps and divergences are visible |

## NEW.1 Minimum Loop

```text
open case
bind subject
submit op attempt
control decision
null carrier / observed receipt
append store record
query projection
```

## Minimum Test Cases

| ID | Scenario | Required Proof |
|---|---|---|
| TC-LOCAL-001 | Agent modifies file. | Attempt, decision, receipt, store record. |
| TC-LOCAL-002 | Dangerous shell command. | Deny/review and no carrier execution. |
| TC-MCP-001 | Tool descriptor drift. | Divergence or review projection. |
| TC-WF-001 | Workflow without receipt. | Missing-receipt divergence. |
| TC-MODEL-001 | Model invocation linked to patch. | Model receipt linked to patch attempt. |
| TC-DB-001 | Database mutation. | Policy gate and receipt. |
| TC-K8S-001 | Rollout observed/interposed. | Receipt or observed divergence. |
| TC-MEM-001 | Memory consolidation scope. | No cross-case recall. |
| TC-AUDIT-001 | Case audit export. | Attempts, decisions, receipts and graph refs. |

## Rule

Tests must not depend on one agent framework. Every failure should produce a divergence, receipt gap, denied decision or explicit unsupported-mode result.
